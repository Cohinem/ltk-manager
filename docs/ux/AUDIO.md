# Audio

The audio support of the workshop: how a Wwise package, bank or WEM opens, what its document
shows, and how its media play. The terms are the ones of the "Audio" section of `GLOSSARY.md`
and of `ltk_wwise`.

## Changes

| Date       | Change                                          |

| 2026-10-29 | Add the audio file document and its media table |

Each edit of this document adds a row at the top. The table keeps the last ten rows.

## The audio file document

A `.wpk`, a `.bnk` or a `.wem` opens into the audio file document, from a project layer and
from the game browser alike. A chunk without a name opens into it when its magic is a package,
a bank or a RIFF `WAVE` file.

The head of the document is the file name, its kind, its media count and its size. Under it:

- A file that does not read shows the reader's error in a danger notice. The error names the
  offset where the reader knows one.
- A bank that the client rejects shows the reason in a warning notice, in the words of
  `Bank::check`.
- A bank whose header ID differs from the bank ID of its file name shows both IDs in an info
  notice. It is information and not a warning, because the client registers a bank under the
  ID of its file name and never reads the header ID (rule W3 of `ltk_wwise`). A game chunk has
  no file name, so it shows no such notice.
- A bank shows its version, bank type, alignment and header ID as field rows, and the ID of
  its file name where it has one.

A bank with a hierarchy has two tabs, Media and Events. Events shows the event count until
the event tree arrives, and it is the tab that opens in a bank without media.

## Media table

One row per media, by source ID. A package lists its entries in file order, a bank its media
index in ascending source ID order, and a WEM is one row of source ID 0.

| Column    | Shows                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (play)    | The play or stop button of the row                                        |
| Source ID | The ID in decimal, in the mono font                                       |
| Codec     | Vorbis, PCM, ADPCM or Opus, or the `wFormatTag` in hex                    |
| Ch        | The channel count                                                         |
| Rate      | The sample rate in samples per second                                     |
| Duration  | `m:ss.cc`, from the `data` size and the byte rate. An estimate for Vorbis |
| Size      | The bytes the media takes in the file, in binary units                    |

Listing a file reads the `fmt ` chunk of each media and decodes no audio, so a package of
thousands of media lists at once. The table is windowed.

A media whose codec has no decoder, or whose header does not read, stays in the table with its
codec and a disabled play button. The button's tooltip gives the reason. A media that fails to
play takes the same state.

The filter keeps the rows whose source ID contains its text. Source ID, Duration and Size sort.
A press on Duration or Size sorts largest first, a second press smallest first, and a third
returns the file order.

### One player

A document plays through one player. Playing a row stops the row that played before it, and
pressing the playing row stops it. The player stops when the file changes on disk and when
the document closes. The play state of the row is the pressed state of its button, and a live
region announces the source ID that plays.

### Keyboard

The table is one tab stop. Focus selects the first row if no row is selected.

| Key                | Action                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Up, Down           | Move the selection one row                |
| Page Up, Page Down | Move the selection ten rows               |
| Home, End          | Select the first or the last row          |
| Space, Enter       | Play the selected row, or stop it         |
| Ctrl+C             | Copy the source ID of the selected row    |
| Shift+F10, Menu    | Open the context menu of the selected row |

### Row actions

The context menu of a row holds Save as `.ogg` (`.wav` for PCM), Save as `.wem` and Copy source
ID. A save asks for its destination in the save dialog and writes through a temporary file.
`.ogg` and `.wav` write the decoded media, and `.wem` writes the bytes as the file holds them.

A layer file that changes on disk lists again, and its media play from the new bytes.
